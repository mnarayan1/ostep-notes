## Address Spaces

Problem 1: Cannot have one program taking up the rest of OS memory, and context switch each time

Problem 2: Cannot know address space of other processes

Address space
- Running program's view of the memory in the system
- Contains code (top), stack (bottom growing up), and heap (below code growing down)

This is virtualizing memory (mfw they use the word virtualizing AGAIN)
